# ExpGui API Reference

This is a condensed version of the API reference, focused on the methods I expect to be used most frequently. As such, it includes more detailed explanations and practical examples to help you get started.

If you havenâ€™t already, I recommend reading the [framework guide](../readme.md) first, as it provides the necessary context for understanding how these methods fit together.

A [full reference](./reference_full.md) is also available, primarily for completeness. If you plan to rely on it, I strongly suggest reviewing and familiarizing yourself with the underlying implementation of the functions.
